# Marketing Campaign Analysis using Predictive Modeling
Challenge hosted in the scope of the Marketing Analytics Class.

The goal was to predict for a charity the customers who are likely to make a donation for a specific fundraising campaign,  and  how  much  money  they  are  likely  to  give  if  they  do.  By  combining  these  two 
predictions, I obtain an expected revenue from each individual. 

- Regression
- Feature Engineering
- MySQL
- Model Selection  

This prediction is crucial to maximize the financial performance of that campaign for the charity.
